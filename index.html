Soaring towards the sky with your legs dangling at 116 kilometers per hour followed by gravity defying drop. You immediately ascend up again in the opposite direction never knowing when you’re going to start falling again. Traveling back and forth builds momentum to reach a max height of 63 meters. Are you brave enough to give it a try?</p>

                <p class='history-p'>Opened in 1882 by entrepreneur Arthur C. Clarke,Odyssey Park was the first of three major amusement parks that put Jamaica’s Filostat Island on the map. The park earned its stripes with its signature attraction: a nerve-chilling, eye-bulging, ego-crushing space-inspired ride called 'Cyclone'. Cyclone had a couple of friends in the form of a Ferris Wheel and miniature railroad. </p>

                <p class='history-p'>While Clarke intended Odyssey to be a safe space for families, some rides still ventured into territory that was risqué. Attractions like the “Whichaway” and the “Human Pool Table” tossed strangers against one another and gave couples an excuse to canoodle. Fire destroyed much of Clarke’s park in 1907, but he responded by building a more elaborate Odyssey that has remained in operation until today.Ever the showman, he even charges ten dollars for visitors to view the charred ruins of the original park.</p>
