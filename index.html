              <img src="images/rideScream.jpg">
                <p>Strap in, and get ready to stop, drop and roar. The Scream catapults you forward so quickly, you’re not even sure if there’s track in front of you. Soaring towards the sky with your legs dangling at 116 kilometers per hour followed by gravity defying drop. You immediately ascend up again in the opposite direction never knowing when you’re going to start falling again. Traveling back and forth builds momentum to reach a max height of 63 meters. Are you brave enough to give it a try?</p>

                <p>Relish the feeling of whitewater rafting on this raging river ride. Since its opening, riders have challenged the rapids on this dizzying water adventure.

Once aboard, riders are at the mercy of this 1,800 feet long journey across powerful waves and torrents, concluding at a cascading waterfall. Every ride is unique, as there’s no telling what your erratic escape will include! With each ride different from the last, be prepared to get drenched while having fun.</p>

                <p>Our most sinister invention yet - a 60 meter tall tower device meant to harness guests' "fear." To activate it, guests are launched up the tower at 64 kilometers per hour, providing unprecedented views of the park. This extreme ride is 5 times the fun as it takes you to the top and drops you into a free fall and just when you thought that was enough it takes you back up for a total of 5 drops.  </p>
